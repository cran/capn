Description: Implements approximation methods for natural capital asset prices suggested by Fenichel and Abbott (2014) <doi:10.1086/676034> in Journal of the Associations of Environmental and Resource Economists (JAERE), Fenichel et al. (2016) <doi:10.1073/pnas.1513779113> in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), and Yun et al. (2017) in PNAS (accepted), and their extensions: creating Chebyshev polynomial nodes and grids, calculating basis of Chebyshev polynomials, approximation and their simulations for: V-approximation (single and multiple stocks, PNAS), P-approximation (single stock, PNAS), and Pdot-approximation (single stock, JAERE).
